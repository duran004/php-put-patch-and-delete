# PHP PUT PATCH AND DELETE
Any api you code without knowing HTTP standards is nonsense. For example: You cannot pull products with POST Method. You must use GET method.
PUT & PATCH for updates.
DELETE Method is mandatory for deletion.
I explained these in my Youtube video: https://youtu.be/Ar0-QZsc7m0

Some people say nonsense like “PHP has no put”, “PHP has no patch” or “PHP has no DELETE” method. This is the proof that there is a repo.
